    ```css
    body {
      font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
      background-color: #f8f9fa;
    }
    #typing-container {
      font-size: 24px;
      color: #343a40;
      margin-top: 20px;
    }
    ```

3. **HTML Template**: Modify the main HTML template `templates/index.html` to adjust the layout and content.

### D. Troubleshooting

This section provides solutions to common issues you might encounter:

- **Issue**: Libraries not loading properly.
  - **Solution**: Ensure that the URLs in your `<script>` and `<link>` tags are correct and accessible. You can also check your internet connection.

```

### Set Up the Python Environment

1. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended) and activate it:

    ```bash

### Run the Application

1. **Run the FastAPI application**:

    ```bash
    uvicorn app:app --reload
    ```

    Replace `app:app` with the correct import path if your FastAPI app is located in a different file or has a different name.

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to see the application in action.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during installation, check the following:

- Ensure all prerequisites are installed.
- Verify that the virtual environment is activated.
- Confirm that the `.env` file is properly configured and placed in the root directory.
- Check the console for error messages and resolve any missing dependencies or syntax errors.

### Additional Notes

- **Updating Dependencies**: If there are updates to the dependencies, you can update your local setup by running:
  
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
    ```

- **Deactivating the Virtual Environment**: Once you're done working on the project, you can deactivate the virtual environment with:

    ```bash
    deactivate
    ```

By following these instructions, you should be able to successfully set up and run the Legal Text Summarizer application on your local machine. If you have any issues, feel free to open an issue on this repository.
