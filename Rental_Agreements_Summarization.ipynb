California Online Privacy Protection Act&nbsp;  CalOPPA&nbsp;is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. – See more at http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/ According to&nbsp;CalOPPA, we agree to the following:  Users can visit our site anonymously. Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website. Our Privacy Policy link includes the word ‘Privacy’ and can easily be found on the page specified above.

Fair Information Practices&nbsp;  The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information. To&nbsp;be in line with Fair Information Practices we will&nbsp;notify you via email within 7 business days&nbsp;should a data breach occur.&nbsp;We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.  CAN-SPAM  Act&nbsp;  The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.

              "  'Arch is a community of volunteers. Rather than providing a complicated pattern of balanced freedoms and restrictions, as well as the time, resources and personnel required to interpret and administer such rules, we have chosen a simple principle to embrace for the benefit of all. Therefore, this entire document may be condensed into one simple admonition:   Proactively seek to give of yourself and to bring only benefit to your peers and community. Arch Linux is a respectful, inclusive community. Anti-social or offensive behaviour will not be tolerated. Having multiple accounts is an unnecessary use of resources. Further, it may be interpreted as trolling behaviour. Criminal solicitation is forbidden in this community. In this context, \"criminal solicitation\" shall mean, \"To actively or implicitly facilitate, incite, move, or persuade others to some act of lawlessness or illegal activity.\" Therefore do not post discussions which demonstrate, or link to, criminal solicitation in any form. This includes, but is not limited to information or links to facilitate illegal drug use, theft, network intrusion, creation of code for malicious purposes, prohibited software copying, prohibited use of copyrighted/patented material, so-called \"warez\", or sites which provide torrents or links to such content. Illegal content shall be removed swiftly and dealt with in full accordance with known applicable law. Spamming is forbidden. Please alert staff to the presence of spam should you encounter it. Offending spam accounts and associated IP addresses will be banned. Do not reply to spam posts as it increases the amount of work required to clean them up. Publicity, if it is related to Arch (as a project or community) or GNU/Linux/FOSS, will usually be allowed. Promoting web-invites, blog posts or commercial promotions are actively discouraged, or outright prohibited. Registering just to promote your issue/cause, FOSS-related or not, treats the community as a resource and is not acceptable. Other considerations in this category include: Arch Linux distribution support ONLY Arch-based distributions have their own support fora and users of those distributions should be actively encouraged to seek support there. These distributions often use different packages, package versions, repositories, or make custom system configurations silently, practically rendering support for such projects within Arch Linux impossible. Community technical support shall only be provided for the Arch Linux distribution and the Arch User Repository. Posting issues with, and requesting support for, derivative distributions or operating systems other than Arch Linux are prohibited. Avoid controversy/controversial topics There is no explicit list of topics considered to be \"trollish\", controversial or provocative, but in the past, posts pertaining to Religion, Sports, Race, Nationalism and Politics have invariably been closed. Therefore,  specifically avoid these and all divisive topics in the Arch community.  The staff certainly realize that such issues are deeply ingrained human realities. However, this is a technical community and is not intended nor able to effectively facilitate such commentary nor the resulting unrest. Furthermore, questioning or discussing the methods used by the Arch Linux development team will be monitored closely and locked or removed if deemed unhelpful and/or unproductive. Specific fora guidelines In addition to the common code, each of the fora has its own specific guidelines summarized in the following subsections. ',\n",

Example: To know the amount of daily active users. Rounded amount of data transmittedE.g. If a user transferred within the session 364MB, we floor it to 300MB. 1843MB of transferred data is floored to 1000MB. We keep just the first digit of the value together with an internal identifier.

You may delete your account or terminate your subscription pursuant to Flickr’s Terms of Use, but note that we may retain certain information as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.  The CCPA requires businesses that “sell” personal information, as the term “sell” is defined under the CCPA, to provide an opt-out from such “sales.” Some people have taken the position that when a website or app uses third-party cookies and similar technology for its own analytics or advertising purposes, the website/app is engaged in a “sale” under the CCPA if the third parties have some ability to use, disclose or retain the data to improve their service or to take steps beyond the most narrowly drawn bounds of merely providing their service to the website/app. Some take this position even when the website/app pays the third party (not vice versa), and in most cases merely provides the third party with an opportunity to collect data directly, instead of sending a copy of personal information to the third party. If you take the position that any of those relationships involve a “sale” within the meaning of the CCPA, then you may consider Flickr to have “sold” what the CCPA calls “identifiers” (like IP addresses), “internet or other electronic network activity information” (like information regarding an individual’s browsing interactions on Flickr.com), and “commercial information” (like the fact that a browser visited a particular page on our website) to those sorts of companies.

              "  'We don’t keep your search history and we don’t create an advertising profile to target you. How does Qwant protect your privacy? When you use Qwant as a search engine, we do not set any advertising cookie on your browser, nor do we look at what you personally searched for previously. When you make a query, it is immediately pseudonymized using the methods set forth in this Privacy Policy. We also undertake to make every effort to guarantee the security and confidentiality of our users’ personal data and in particular to prevent such data from being altered, deleted or accessed by unauthorized third parties. The URL of Qwant begins with “HTTPS”, which indicates to users that they are communicating their data securely through the TLS protocol. Technically, the TLS guarantees visitors that their data cannot be intercepted while in transit over the network in a fraudulent or accidental manner. In addition, the padlock that appears in front of the Qwant URL on most browsers certifies that you are browsing a secure site. Qwant has a Privacy office dedicated to protecting your privacy. It also has a Data Protection Officer (DPO). Both work closely with eachother to ensure that the relevant regulation regarding personal data is applied as strongly as it should. The DPO keeps an updated register of all processing of personal data made by Qwant for his services. For instance, when you create an account on the site, you can choose to fill in your profile and this is a processing of personal data for which the register will say how data may be kept (and how long), and who can access it. The DPO makes this register available to anyone who asks : privacy@qwant.com We commit to do anything we can to ensure the security and confidentiality of our users personal data, including by preventing data damage, loss, or access by unauthorized third parties. Qwant’s URL has the HTTPS header that shows users they communicate with Qwant through a secure channel using the TLS protocol. Technically, TLS ensures users that their data can’t be intercepted by fraud. Moreover, the green lock that you see on most browsers when using Qwant certifies that you are browsing a secure website. We use your browser’s “local storage” technology to store your browser settings (language, enabling or disabling options) on your device. If you change these technical parameters, a cookie may be installed on your browser, exclusively for the purpose of preserving these parameters. You have the possibility to delete the “local storage” data or the cookie from your browser. However, the provision of a search engine requires some data processing. In such cases, we collect some personal data such as your name, firstname and email address when you register to our services, or when you use forms available on our website. What data is processed by Qwant when you make search queries? Qwant also collects connection\\xa0data, not associated with your search queries, only to ensure the security of its information system and, if you create or modify Boards, to respect the obligation to identify content creators such as mandated by French law (article 6-II de la Loi pour la confiance en l’économie numérique).  Even when you are connected with an ID, we don’t use any cookie nor any other tracking device when you browse the site. The only technology that may be installed on your browser, called “local storage”, is used to locally save your settings (language, activation or deactivation of options…). In order to have knowledge of the existing contents on the Web and to offer you the most relevant results, Qwant automatically indexes Web pages on which personal data of any kind is likely to be present. Qwant retains this data until two years after the last indexing by our robots, based on our legitimate interest in having an index of publicly available content on the Web (article 6.1.f of the GDPR). A salted hash of the user’s IP address with the salt that changes ever three months at the latest (i.e. the result of a mathematical formula based on this IP address, not the IP address itself); Personal data that you transmit are never disclosed or sold by Qwant to third parties, except for job applications that may be shared with recruiting\\xa0partners, unless you ask us not to. After this period, the keywords are no longer associated to an identifier and are retained for 12 months for aggregate statistical analysis (e.g. to know how many times a keyword is searched over a given period of time). This processing is necessary for the performance of Qwant’s Terms of Use, on the basis of article 6.1.b of the GDPR (processing necessary for the performance of the contract between you and us), and meets Qwant’s legitimate interest (article 6.1.f of the GDPR) to secure and make its services reliable. For Qwant and Qwant Junior accounts, your data is removed 7 days after you request that the account be deleted. If you use a EDU Qwant Junior account (edu.qwantjunior.com), your data is removed 3 months after the account deletion request. During this period, you can ask that your account be reactivated using your initial username and password. For data that may be collected when you exercize some rights (access, opposition, rectification, right to be forgotten…), the duration\\xa0of retention depends on what the law prescribes for each of these rights. Please refer to the next section of this Privacy Policy for details. For connection data that the information system security department may access, the\\xa0duration of retention is 6 months. For Qwant Boards, French law makes it mandatory to keep some connection data (e.g. user ID used, URL or position, nature of the operation, time…) for one year. In order to provide you with relevant results from around the world when we do not have the answers to your queries by ourselves, we have partnered with Microsoft Ireland Operations Limited to provide a portion of our search results and provide contextual advertising based on the keywords entered and your geographic region. For this purpose, as well as for the security and reliability of our partner’s services (detection of spam, automated activity, fraudulent clicks on ads…), Qwant may transfer to this partner the following pseudonymous data related to your query: – The searched keywords; – The type and version of the browser used (User Agent); – The first three bytes of your IP address; – The approximate geographical area at the origin of the search, at the scale of a region or a city; – A salted hash generated from: your IP address, your User Agent and a salt that changes at least every 3 months. This data is transferred to this partner within the European Union, and may be retained in accordance with Bing’s Privacy Policy for a maximum duration of 18 months. This processing is necessary for the performance of Qwant’s Terms of Use, on the basis of article 6.1.b of the GDPR (processing necessary for the performance of the contract between you and us), and responds to the legitimate interest of Microsoft Ireland Operations Limited (article 6.1.f) to make its services secure and reliable. Qwant also keeps other data related to your use of the services (associated for 7 days with a hash calculated from your IP address and the User Agent of your browser) including : – The source of the user’s visit to the site (the HTTP referrer and the search field used to trigger the request); Qwant does not require you to register to use the search engine. However, you may wish to register to log in and personalize services. You are free to manage your account information (modify, correct, update and delete information). In order to manage its users’ accounts and to send our newsletter (if you have chosen to subscribe), Qwant collects the following data: When you use Qwant, no personal information whatsoever is neither captured or transmitted to advertisers. In details: – No third party cookies – No trackers – No behavioral targeting – No campaigns mixing legit and promotional content (native advertising) the right to object to processing under the conditions provided for by the regulations (article 21 of the GDPR); – the right to limit the processing of such data under the conditions provided for by the regulations (article 18 of the GDPR); right to data portability (Article 20 of the GDPR); Right to erasure and “right to be forgotten”. This right gives you the possibility to have your data deleted as soon as possible by Qwant. Concretely, you have the possibility to delete your account by following instructions detailed here. As of the request to close the account, the data you have provided will then be deleted after 7 days, subject to our legal and regulatory obligations. Similarly, you may request deletion of your job application if you no longer wish it to be processed by Qwant. Upon receipt of your request to close your application file, all data you have provided will then be deleted as soon as possible and within 15 days of your request at the latest. When videos are embedded within search results, you can watch them without leaving Qwant. We don’t retain data related to your use of the videos. However, the videos are loaded by your browser from the servers of their hosting service, which may collect some of your personal data. The playing of videos obtained from the YouTube API Services is then subject to YouTube’s Terms of Service and to Google’s Privacy Policy. Videos obtained from the Dailymotion API are subject to Dailymotion’s Terms of Use, and to Dailymotion’s Privacy Policy. ',\n",

You may not assign your rights under these Terms without Riot Games’ prior written consent, and any unauthorized assignment by you shall be null and void.

Why do we use cookies? Cookies help us provide, protect and improve the Facebook Products, such as by personalising content, tailoring and measuring ads, and providing a safer experience. The cookies that we use include session cookies, which are deleted when you close your browser, and persistent cookies, which stay on your browser until they expire or you delete them. While the cookies that we use may change from time to time as we improve and update the Facebook Products, we use them for the following purposes: Authentication We use cookies to verify your account and determine when you’re logged in so we can make it easier for you to access the Facebook Products and show you the appropriate experience and features.  For example: We use cookies to keep you logged in as you navigate between Facebook pages. Cookies also help us remember your browser so you do not have to keep logging into Facebook and so you can more easily log into Facebook via third-party apps and websites.Security, site and product integrity We use cookies to help us keep your account, data and the Facebook Products safe and secure.  For example: Cookies can help us identify and impose additional security measures when someone may be attempting to access a Facebook account without authorization, for instance, by rapidly guessing different passwords. We also use cookies to store information that allows us to recover your account in the event you’ve forgotten your password or to require additional authentication if you tell us your account has been hacked. We also use cookies to combat activity that violates our policies or otherwise degrades our ability to provide the Facebook Products.  For example: Cookies help us fight spam and phishing attacks by enabling us to identify computers that are used to create large numbers of fake Facebook accounts. We also use cookies to detect computers infected with malware and to take steps to prevent them from causing further harm. Cookies also help us prevent underage people from registering for Facebook accounts.Advertising, recommendations, insights and measurement While the cookies that we use may change from time to time as we improve and update the Facebook Products, we use them for the following purposes: We use cookies to help us show ads and to make recommendations for businesses and other organisations to people who may be interested in the products, services or causes they promote We use cookies to better understand how people use the Facebook Products so that we can improve them.  For example: Cookies can help us understand how people use the Facebook service, analyse which parts of the Facebook Products people find most useful and engaging, and identify features that could be improved.Google Analytics We also set cookies from the Facebook.com domain that work with the Google Analytics service to help us understand how businesses use Facebook's developer sites.  Our business partners may also choose to share information with Facebook from cookies set in their own websites' domains, whether or not you have a Facebook account or are logged in. Specifically, cookies named _fbc or _fbp may be set on the domain of the Facebook business partner whose site you're visiting. Unlike cookies that are set on Facebook's own domains, these cookies aren’t accessible by Facebook when you're on a site other than the one on which they were set, including when you are on one of our domains. They serve the same purposes as cookies set in Facebook's own domain, which are to personalise content (including ads), measure ads, produce analytics and provide a safer experience, as set out in this Cookies Policy.   Facebook uses cookies and receives information when you visit those sites and apps, including device information and information about your activity, without any further action from you. This occurs whether or not you have a Facebook account or are logged in.   For example, our measurement partners use cookies on the Facebook Products to help advertisers understand the effectiveness of their Facebook advertising campaigns and to compare the performance of those campaigns to ads displayed on other websites and apps.

As part of this continual improvement, we sometimes add or remove features and functionalities, increase or decrease limits to our services, and start offering new services or stop offering old ones. We maintain a rigorous product research program, so before we change or stop offering a service, we carefully consider your interests as a user, your reasonable expectations, and the potential impact on you and others. We only change or stop offering services for valid reasons, such as to improve performance or security, to comply with law, to prevent illegal activities or abuse, to reflect technical developments, or because a feature or an entire service is no longer popular enough or economical to offer. If we make material changes that negatively impact your use of our services or if we stop offering a service, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice and an opportunity to export your content from your Google Account using Google Takeout, except in urgent situations such as preventing abuse, responding to legal requirements, or addressing security and operability issues. When you upload, submit, store, send or receive content to or through our Services, you give Google (and those we work with) a worldwide license to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works (such as those resulting from translations, adaptations or other changes we make so that your content works better with our Services), communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute such content. The rights you grant in this license are for the limited purpose of operating, promoting, and improving our Services, and to develop new ones. This license continues even if you stop using our Services (for example, for a business listing you have added to Google Maps). Some Services may offer you ways to access and remove content that has been provided to that Service. Also, in some of our Services, there are terms or settings that narrow the scope of our use of the content submitted in those Services. We also make various policies, help centers, and other resources available to you to answer common questions and to set expectations about using our services. These resources include our Privacy Policy, Copyright Help Center, Safety Center, and other pages accessible from our policies site. Our automated systems analyze your content (including emails) to provide you personally relevant product features, such as customized search results, tailored advertising, and spam and malware detection. We want to maintain a respectful environment for everyone, which means you must follow these basic rules of conduct: comply with applicable laws, including export control, sanctions, and human trafficking laws you can choose your settings so your name and photo do not appear in an ad harassing, Our service-specific additional terms and policies provide additional details about appropriate conduct that everyone using those services must follow. Your content remains yours, which means that you retain any intellectual property rights that you have in your content. For example, you have intellectual property rights in the creative content you make, such as reviews you write. Google may also stop providing Services to you, or add or create new limits to our Services at any time. If we discontinue a Service, where reasonably possible, we will give you reasonable advance notice and a chance to get information out of that Service. OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY SET OUT IN THESE TERMS OR ADDITIONAL TERMS, NEITHER GOOGLE NOR ITS SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS MAKE ANY SPECIFIC PROMISES ABOUT THE SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE DON’T MAKE ANY COMMITMENTS ABOUT THE CONTENT WITHIN THE SERVICES, THE SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS OF THE SERVICES, OR THEIR RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY, OR ABILITY TO MEET YOUR NEEDS. WE PROVIDE THE SERVICES “AS IS”. This license is: worldwide, which means it’s valid anywhere in the world non-exclusive, which means you can license your content to others sublicense these rights to:  other users to allow the services to work as designed, such as enabling you to share photos with people you choose our contractors who’ve signed agreements with us that are consistent with these terms, only for the limited purposes described in the Purpose section below  PurposeThis license is for the limited purpose of:   operating and improving the services, which means allowing the services to work as designed and creating new features and functionalities. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than fourteen days after they are posted. If you remove from our services any content that’s covered by this license, then our systems will stop making that content publicly available in a reasonable amount of time. There are two exceptions:  If you already shared your content with others before removing it. For example, if you shared a photo with a friend who then made a copy of it, or shared it again, then that photo may continue to appear in your friend’s Google Account even after you remove it from your Google Account. If you make your content available through other companies’ services, it’s possible that search engines, including Google Search, will continue to find and display your content as part of their search results. The laws of California, U.S.A., excluding California’s conflict of laws rules, will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to these terms or the Services. All claims arising out of or relating to these terms or the Services will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA, You’re responsible for what you do with your Google Account, including taking reasonable steps to keep your Google Account secure, and we encourage you to regularly use the Security Checkup. If you choose to give us feedback, such as suggestions to improve our services, we may act on your feedback without obligation to you. If you think someone is infringing your intellectual property rights, you can send us notice of the infringement and we’ll take appropriate action. For example, we suspend or close the Google Accounts of repeat copyright infringers as described in our Copyright Help Center. Finally, some of our services give you access to content that belongs to other people or organizations — for example, a store owner’s description of their own business, or a newspaper article displayed in Google News. You may not use this content without that person or organization’s permission, or as otherwise allowed by law. The views expressed in other people or organizations’ content are theirs, and don’t necessarily reflect Google’s views. We provide our services using reasonable skill and care. If we don’t meet the quality level described in this warranty, you agree to tell us and we’ll work with you to try to resolve the issue.

For business users and organizations onlyIf you’re a business user or organization, then to the extent allowed by applicable law:  You’ll indemnify Google and its directors, officers, employees, and contractors for any third-party legal proceedings (including actions by government authorities) arising out of or relating to your unlawful use of the services or violation of these terms or service-specific additional terms.  Google’s total liability arising out of or relating to these terms is limited to the greater of (1) €500 or (2) 125% of the fees that you paid to use the relevant services in the 12 months before the breach  If we reasonably believe that any of your content (1) breaches these terms, service-specific additional terms or policies, (2) violates applicable law, or (3) could harm our users, third parties, or Google, then we reserve the right to take down some or all of that content in accordance with applicable law. Suspending or terminating your access to Google services Google reserves the right to suspend or terminate your access to the services or delete your Google Account if any of these things happen:  you materially or repeatedly breach these terms, service-specific additional terms or policies we’re required to do so to comply with a legal requirement or a court order we reasonably believe that your conduct causes harm or liability to a user, third party, or Google — for example, by hacking, phishing, spamming, misleading others, or scraping content that doesn’t belong to you Of course, you’re always free to stop using our services at any time. If you do stop using a service, we’d appreciate knowing why so that we can continue improving our services. When we receive data disclosure requests, our team reviews them to make sure they satisfy legal requirements and Google’s data disclosure policies. Google Ireland Limited accesses and discloses data, including communications, in accordance with the laws of Ireland, and EU law applicable in Ireland. For more information about the data disclosure requests that Google receives worldwide, and how we respond to such requests, see our Transparency Report and Privacy Policy. If it turns out that a particular term is not valid or enforceable, this will not affect any other terms. If you don’t follow these terms or the service-specific additional terms, and we don’t take action right away, that doesn’t mean we’re giving up any rights that we may have, such as taking action in the future. If we materially change these terms or service-specific additional terms, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice and the opportunity to review the changes, except (1) when we launch a new service or feature, or (2) in urgent situations, such as preventing ongoing abuse or responding to legal requirements.

Most user concerns can be resolved by use of our Steam support site at https://support.steampowered.com/. If Valve is unable to resolve your concerns and a dispute remains between you and Valve, this Section explains how the parties have agreed to resolve it. YOU AND VALVE AGREE TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS BETWEEN US IN INDIVIDUAL BINDING ARBITRATION. THAT INCLUDES, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO: (i) ANY ASPECT OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN US. (ii) THIS AGREEMENT.

This Section does not prevent you from bringing your dispute to the attention of any federal, state, or local government agencies that can, if the law allows, seek relief from us for you. An arbitration is a proceeding before a neutral arbitrator, instead of before a judge or jury. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court, and provides more limited discovery. It follows different rules than court proceedings, and is subject to very limited review by courts. The arbitrator will issue a written decision and provide a statement of reasons if requested by either party. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND VALVE ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND TO HAVE A TRIAL BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY. You and Valve agree to make reasonable, good faith efforts to informally resolve any dispute before initiating arbitration. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send the other a written notice that describes the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and sets forth the relief sought. If you and Valve do not reach an agreement to resolve that claim or dispute within 30 days after the notice is received, you or Valve may commence an arbitration. you and Valve agree that any claim asserted in any legal proceeding shall be commenced and maintained exclusively in any state or federal court located in King County, Washington, having subject matter jurisdiction. You and Valve hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts. YOU AND VALVE AGREE TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS BETWEEN US IN INDIVIDUAL BINDING ARBITRATION. THAT INCLUDES, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO: (i) ANY ASPECT OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN US. (ii) THIS AGREEMENT. OR (iii) YOUR USE OF STEAM, YOUR ACCOUNT, HARDWARE OR THE CONTENT AND SERVICES. IT APPLIES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH CLAIMS ARE BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STATUTE, FRAUD, UNFAIR COMPETITION, MISREPRESENTATION OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND INCLUDES ALL CLAIMS BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF ANOTHER PARTY. YOU AND VALVE AGREE NOT TO BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, WHISTLE BLOWER ACTION, OR CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE ARBITRATION, EVEN IF AAA’s RULES WOULD OTHERWISE ALLOW ONE. THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT OF THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM. You and Valve also agree not to seek to combine any action or arbitration with any other action or arbitration without the consent of all parties to this Agreement and all other actions or arbitrations. This Agreement does not permit class, collective, or representative arbitration. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, in the event that any provision of this Agreement shall be held by an arbitrator, court, or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be illegal or unenforceable, such provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the remaining portions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.

It can be summarized as IP address and client device and a whole bunch of data on how their infrastructure is doing. From neither will we hand over individual data to anybody else and any privacy breaches we will disclose as soon as possible. We also delete, anonymize and remove data regularly.   Our software, be it the Nextcloud server or the Android or iOS apps, are designed to not sent any user data to us. The optional Usage Survey app can sent usage statistics like installed apps to us to help us improve our service. You can review and approve the data before it is sent. We store the data aggregated and not per user, so a theft of our data can not be used to get any information about any specific installation.  With regards to third party apps: we can not take any responsibility for third-party apps and the data they store or sent about users However, we do not have the ability to check all code of all third party applications and thus we recommend you are careful when installing third party apps. What personal information do we collect from the people that visit our blog, website or app?  Like most websites, nextcloud.com collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.  nextcloud.com does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information to third parties unless legally obliged to do so. We honour the do-not-track directive. nextcloud.com will not track anything if this is enabled. Furthermore, our website visit statistics tool Mamoto is configured to anonymize visitor IP addresses data by not storing the last digits of all IP addresses.  When do we collect information? The Play Store version equal to or newer than 1.5.0 for Nextcloud supports push notifications which use the Google servers. However Google does not have access to the actual notification data. Only a header with a subject is sent via Google, but in encrypted form, and the rest of the content is retrieved directly from your Nextcloud server and not sent through Google.  How do we use your information?  If you enter an email address on our site, you agree with that (otherwise we can not sent you that white paper either). We might sent follow-up emails (like a reminder if you did not download the white paper, or a notification of a new white paper), from which you can opt-out on the bottom of the emails.  In line with our business strategy of not monetizing home and small business users but aim for large enterprises, our goal is to ONLY track employees of companies using their work email. We try to drop all home/private users from the database as soon as we find out they are private users, of course after we have sent them the white paper they asked for. For example, we remove contacts with an @gmail or @icloud address and keep obviously business related addresses (@acme @example-ltd @placeholder-corp.com). For those we then might follow up on a End-to-end Encryption white paper download a week later with an offer to download our Server-side Encryption white paper.

By visiting protonmail.com and using the Services provided here, you agree to the terms outlined in th All data storage infrastructure is also located solely within Switzerland, and thus governed by the laws and regulations of Switzerland. Such data will only be used to contact you with important notifications about ProtonMail, to send you information related to security, to send you an invitation link to create your ProtonMail account, to verify your ProtonMail account, or to send you password recovery links if you enable the option. The Company is domiciled in Switzerland and all data storage infrastructure is also located solely within Switzerland, and thus governed by the laws and regulations of Switzerland.  You are free, at any given time, to opt-out of those features through the account settings panel. In order to pursue our legitimate interest of preventing the creation of accounts by spam bots or human spammers, ProtonMail uses a variety of human verification methods. You may be asked to verify using either reCaptcha, Email, or SMS. IP addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers provided are saved temporarily in order to send you a verification code and to determine if you are a spammer. If this data is saved permanently, it is always saved as a cryptographic hash, which ensures that the raw values cannot be deciphered by us. We also have no technical means to access your encrypted message contents. Account creation: It is not necessary to provide personal information in order to create an account, but you may provide an external email address for notification or password recovery purposes.  It is not necessary to provide personal information in order to create an account, Should you choose to provide it, we do associate another email address with your account (for password recovery, or notifications). The legal basis for processing is consent and you are free to remove that data in the account panel of your ProtonMail account.  Account activity: Due to limitations of the SMTP protocol, we have access to the following email metadata: sender and recipient email addresses, the IP address incoming messages originated from, message subject, and message sent and received times. We do NOT have access to encrypted message content but unencrypted messages sent from external providers to ProtonMail are scanned for Spam and Viruses to pursue the legitimate interest of the protection of our users. We also have access to the following records of account activity: number of messages sent, amount of storage space used, total number of messages, last login time.  Communicating with ProtonMail: Your communications with the Company, such as support requests, bug reports, or feature requests may be saved by our staff.

Anonymous cash or Bitcoin payments and donations are accepted however.   We also don't record your login IP address unless this feature is specifically enabled by the user. When you use our native applications, we (or the mobile app platform providers) may collect certain information in addition to the information mentioned elsewhere in this Policy. We may use mobile analytics software (such as fabric.io app statistics and crash reporting, Play Store app statistics, App Store app statistics, or self-hosted Sentry crash reporting) to send crash information to our developers so that we can fix bugs rapidly.   However, IP logs are sometimes kept to combat abuse and fraud, and your IP address may be retained if you are engaged in activities that breach our terms and conditions (spamming, DDoS attacks against ProtonMail infrastructure, brute force attacks, etc).

In case of violation of your rights, you have the right to lodge a complaint to the competent supervisory authority. ProtonMail may from time to time, contest requests if there is a public interest in doing so. In such situations, the Company will not comply with the request until all legal or other remedies have been exhausted. Therefore, not all requests described in our Transparency Report will lead to data disclosure. When a ProtonMail account is closed, data is immediately deleted from production servers. Active accounts will have data retained indefinitely. Deleted emails are also permanently deleted from production servers. Deleted data may be retained in our backups for up to 14 days.

These partners provide information about your activities off Facebook These partners provide information about your activities off Facebook—including information about your device, websites you visit, purchases you make, the ads you see, and how you use their services—whether or not you have a Facebook account or are logged into Facebook. For example, a game developer could use our API to tell us what games you play, or a business could tell us about a purchase you made in its store.  We also receive information about your online and offline actions and purchases from third-party data providers who have the rights to provide us with your information. How do we use this information?We use the information we have (subject to choices you make) as described below and to provide and support the Facebook Products and related services described in the Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms. Here's how: Information across Facebook Products and devices: We connect information about your activities on different Facebook Products and devices to provide a more tailored and consistent experience on all Facebook Products you use, wherever you use them. We use location-related information-such as your current location, where you live, the places you like to go, and the businesses and people you're near-to provide, personalize and improve our Products, including ads, for you and others. Face recognition: If you have it turned on, we use face recognition technology to recognize you in photos, videos and camera experiences. The face-recognition templates we create may constitute data with special protections under the laws of your country. Ads and other sponsored content: We use the information we have about you-including information about your interests, actions and connections-to select and personalize ads, offers and other sponsored content that we show you. We use the information we have to send you marketing communications, communicate with you about our Products, and let you know about our policies and terms. We also use your information to respond to you when you contact us. When you share and communicate using our Products, you choose the audience for what you share. For example, when you post on Facebook, you select the audience for the post, such as a group, all of your friends, the public, or a customized list of people. Similarly, when you use Messenger or Instagram to communicate with people or businesses, those people and businesses can see the content you send. You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who can see your activity on our Products can choose to share it with others on and off our Products, including people and businesses outside the audience you shared with. For example, when you share a post or send a message to specific friends or accounts, they can download, screenshot, or reshare that content to others across or off our Products, in person or in virtual reality experiences such as Facebook Spaces. Also, when you comment on someone else's post or react to their content, your comment or reaction is visible to anyone who can see the other person's content, and that person can change the audience later. Information collected by these third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not this one. If the ownership or control of all or part of our Products or their assets changes, we may transfer your information to the new owner. Sharing with Third-Party Partners We work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our Products or who use Facebook Business Tools to grow their businesses, which makes it possible to operate our companies and provide free services to people around the world. We don't sell any of your information to anyone, and we never will. Here are the types of third parties we share information with:Partners who use our analytics services.We provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and businesses understand how people are engaging with their posts, listings, Pages, videos and other content on and off the Facebook Products. For example, Page admins and Instagram business profiles receive information about the number of people or accounts who viewed, reacted to, or commented on their posts, as well as aggregate demographic and other information that helps them understand interactions with their Page or account.Advertisers.We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads and how their ads are performing, but we don't share information that personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us permission. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes software engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We also confirm which Facebook ads led you to make a purchase or take an action with an advertiser.Measurement partners.We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to provide analytics and measurement reports to our partners.Partners offering goods and services in our Products.When you subscribe to receive premium content, or buy something from a seller in our Products, the content creator or seller can receive your public information and other information you share with them, as well as the information needed to complete the transaction, including shipping and contact details.Vendors and service providers.We provide information and content to vendors and service providers who support our business, such as by providing technical infrastructure services, analyzing how our Products are used, providing customer service, facilitating payments or conducting surveys.Researchers and academics.We also provide information and content to research partners and academics to conduct research that advances scholarship and innovation that support our business or mission, and enhances discovery and innovation on topics of general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and well-being.Law enforcement or legal requests.We share information with law enforcement or in response to legal requests in the circumstances outlined below.Learn more about how you can control the information about you that you or others share with third-party partners in the Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.

For example, when you search for something on Facebook, you can access and delete that query from within your search history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after 6 months. To delete your account at any time, please visit the Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings. We share information globally, both internally within the Facebook Companies, and externally with our partners and with those you connect and share with around the world in accordance with this policy. Your information may, for example, be transferred or transmitted to, or stored and processed in the United States or other countries outside of where you live for the purposes as described in this policy.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION THIS SECTION AND THE NEXT SECTION ONLY APPLIES TO YOU IF YOU ARE A UNITED STATES RESIDENT.  PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY - IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.  You and Discord agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions.  Most disputes can be resolved without resorting to arbitration. In the event of a dispute, you agree to provide us notice of the dispute. This notice must provide a brief, written description of the dispute, the relief requested and the contact information of the party giving it. You must send any such notice to Discord by email to disputes@discord.com and by U.S. Mail to Discord Inc., 444 De Haro Street #200, San Francisco, CA 94107.  The parties agree to use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation with one another, and good faith negotiations shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, disputes concerning patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets and claims of piracy or unauthorized use of the Site shall not be subject to arbitration, and the notice and good faith negotiation required by this paragraph shall not apply to these types of disputes.  Binding Arbitration. Except as provided herein, if we cannot resolve a dispute informally, any dispute will be resolved only by binding arbitration to be held in the U.S. state in which you reside. For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in San Francisco, California. Discord and you further agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any state or federal court in San Francisco, California to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.  The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator, governed by the rules of JAMS that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated (referred to as the “JAMS Rules”) and under the rules set forth in these Terms. If there is a conflict between the JAMS Rules and the rules set forth in these Terms, the rules set forth in these Terms will govern. ARBITRATION MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL. You may, in arbitration, seek any and all remedies otherwise available to you pursuant to your state’s law.  To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, Discord will pay the additional cost. Discord shall also bear the cost of any arbitration fees, unless the arbitrator finds your claims, defenses, or other fee-generating activity to be asserted or conducted for an improper purpose or frivolous. You are responsible for all other additional costs that you may incur in the arbitration including, without limitation, attorney’s fees and expert witness costs unless Discord is specifically required to pay such fees under applicable law. The decision of the arbitrator will be in writing and binding and conclusive on Discord and you, and judgment to enforce the decision may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction. Discord and you agree that dispositive motions, including without limitation motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment, will be allowed in the arbitration. The arbitrator must follow these Terms of Service and can award the same damages and relief as a court, including injunctive or other equitable relief and attorney’s fees. Discord and you understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision, Discord and you would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. Discord and you further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and that the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.  If Discord’s or your claim is solely for monetary relief of $10,000 or less and does not include a request for any type of equitable remedy, the party bringing the claim may choose whether the arbitration of the claim will be conducted, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing under the JAMS Rules, solely based on documents submitted to the arbitrator.  You or Discord may choose to pursue a claim in small claims court where jurisdiction and venue over you and Discord otherwise qualifies for such small claims court and where the claim does not include a request for any type of equitable relief. However, if you decide to pursue a claim in small claims court, you agree to still provide Discord with advance notice by email to disputes@discord.com and by U.S. Mail to Discord Inc., 444 De Haro Street #200, San Francisco, CA 94107.  Opt-Out Right. You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the provisions requiring arbitration by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to Discord by email to arbitration-opt-out@discord.com. The notice must be sent within 90 days of this Terms of Service taking effect, or your account creation on the Service. If you do not opt out via this method, you will be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of these paragraphs. If you opt out of the provisions requiring arbitration, Discord will not be bound by them either. If any clause within this Arbitration Section is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that specific clause will be severed from this section, and the remainder of its provisions will be given full force and effect.  Survival. This Arbitration section shall survive any termination of your account or the Service. Except as provided herein, if we cannot resolve a dispute informally, any dispute will be resolved only by binding arbitration to be held in the U.S. state in which you reside. For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in San Francisco, California.

CLASS WAIVER THIS SECTION AND THE PREVIOUS SECTION ONLY APPLIES TO YOU IF YOU ARE A UNITED STATES RESIDENT.  PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS.  Discord and you agree to resolve any dispute in an individual capacity, and not on behalf of, or as part of, any purported class, consolidated, or representative proceeding.  The arbitrator cannot combine more than one person’s or entity’s claims into a single case, and cannot preside over any consolidated, class or representative proceeding (unless we agree otherwise). And, the arbitrator’s decision or award in one person’s or entity’s case can only impact the person or entity that brought the claim, not other Discord customers, and cannot be used to decide other disputes with other customers.

All data is stored in a German datacenter, and therefore the data is subject to German law as well as EU law.  We do not collect any personal data of visitors of the NewPipe website. We do not install cookies on your system, and we do not track our users.  Personal data such as the IP address are only processed for the purpose of serving the pages by our webserver software, and are deleted from the memory immediately after the page has been sent to the user. Server logs To have a minimum of control in scenarios where our website is abused, for example denial-of-service attacks, we configured our webserver to create a so-called acces log. This log file contains a list of all requests made to this server, each request in a separate line. The logged lines contain the following information:  the IP address that was used to make the request a timestamp the URL the HTTP status code the user agent the user‘s browser sends automatically  We need to keep logs of the IP addresses sending requests to our server. As IP addresses are considered personal data and we respect the privacy of our users, we only keep enough of the IP address to be able to able to react to abuse (e.g., DoS and other attacks). Personal data such as the IP address are only processed for the purpose of serving the pages by our webserver software, and are deleted from the memory immediately after the page has been sent to the user. We calculate prefixes of the IP addresses to anonymize them as follows:  For IPv4 addresses, we remove the last two bytes to anonymize them. For example, an IP address such as 12.34.56.78 would be logged as 12.34.0.0. For IPv6 addresses, we remove all bytes but the first two. For example, an IP address such as 2001:db8:85a3:8d3:1319:8a2e:370:7344 would be logged as 2001:db8:0:0:0:0:0:0 (short 2001:0db8::).   Users have the ability to leave comments themselves. We use the excellent isso software to provide this feature. If a user sends a comment, the following data is collected:  mandatory data:  a name (can, but does not have to be a user's real name), allowing users to let others (including the NewPipe project) identify them, for example on other services, such as GitHub.   Data collection and processing by Sentry, our bug report tracking system We maintain an instance of Sentry, a bug tracking and aggregation system, in order to process user-provided bug reports including crash logs and messages. Due to the amount of bug reports we receive every day (varies from a few hundred to a few thousand e-mails every week), we can not check every report for personal data by hand. We ask you to ensure you don't send us any personal data you don't want to share with us.  Every user has the right to request the correction or completion (GDPR Art. 16) or deletion (GDPR Art. 17) or restriction of use (GDPR Art. 18) of the data sent to us at any time.  In many cases, due to our philosophy, the data is highly anonymized. If your data is, and we think it should be, anonymized so that we cannot associate with any user, we can most likely not delete it from our system. In these cases, however, no personal data is collected. In many cases, due to our philosophy, the data is highly anonymized.  According to GDPR Art. 77, you may, at any time, file a complaint about our data processing at your local data protection officer. All data is stored on a dedicated server administrated by the NewPipe project. Neither the hosting provider nor any other third party does have any access to the data, as it is stored encryptedly on the hard disks using so-called full-disk encryption.  The data is processed and stored only for the purposes described above. We will not share any of the data with third parties.  \",\n",

To learn how we use data for publishers and creators visit the Publisher Privacy Policy on the Basic Attention Token website Your IP address will not be stored by Brave, but it may be stored by the website you have visited.  If you switch on Brave Rewards you are assigned a “wallet” identifier by Uphold, our payments partner. We record this identifier on servers operated by Amazon and Heroku (a Salesforce company) in the United States. These services are operated in the United States, and are certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield agreement, which provides safeguards intended to be equivalent to those provided in the EU. Each time Brave sends users a monthly gift of BAT it makes a record of their IP addresses that can be analysed to safeguard against fraud. Even with Brave Rewards enabled, we never collect your browsing history or similar information, and we can’t derive this information from your contributions to content creators and sites. Instead, we aggregate contributions among all Brave users, and we cannot trace contributions to individual users, or link any of your contributions together. If you switch on Brave Rewards and switch on ads (in Rewards settings) you will receive notifications promoting ads, and BAT to reward you for viewing those ads. While the ads you see are based on interests inferred from your browsing, Brave Ads is private and anonymous. No data that identifies you or that can be linked to you as an individual leaves the Brave browser on your device.  We’ll update this policy whenever we make material changes to our practices, and we’ll announce it to let you know.

              "  'x Terms of Use   Roblox Privacy and Cookie Policy   Developer Exchange Terms of Use   Roblox Community Rules   Roblox Name and Logo - Community Usage Guidelines   Roblox Community Rules  Roblox Community Rules  The following Community Rules apply to all Roblox users, and are part of the Terms of Use. These Rules are made up of two sections. All Roblox users and those participating in Roblox events (online or offline) must follow Section I. Developers must follow Section I and the additional rules in Section II.  Section I. Basic Rules – Applicable to all Users (players, developers, and everyone else) and to anyone participating in a Roblox related event (online or real life). Roblox helps power the imagination of our users. Those users are of all ages and come from around the world to create adventures, play games, roleplay and socialize. \\xa0We strive to create a community that balances the needs, safety and interests of this truly diverse user base. To help achieve this goal, we put together these Rules, which apply to whatever you do on Roblox (whether playing, chatting, sending messages, posting comments, creating or publishing content, dressing up your avatar, and anything else in the games or on the platform).\\xa0These Rules also apply to anything that you participate in the real world or online related to Roblox, such as the Roblox Developer Conference (\"RDC\"), Roblox developer chat channels and other online or offline events and gatherings hosted by or related to Roblox. Please remember to periodically review these Rules, as they will be updated from time to time. As good members of the community, you should report all violations by using our Report Abuse\\xa0system, which is located throughout the site and in-game.   Guiding Principles   Be friendly, patient, and welcoming. Support a safe environment and help us to ensure that everyone follows these Rules.  Be respectful. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.  Be careful in the words that you choose. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren’t acceptable.  Try to understand why we disagree. Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. The strength of our community comes from its diversity, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Let\\'s focus on working together to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.  These are the rules of conduct that everyone on Roblox must follow. Below are some specific examples. But, these are much broader than the examples below and you should stick to these Rules if you are uncertain as to whether any particular action is allowed.   Personal information. We strongly encourage you to protect your personal information. In some cases (such as when you are under 13), we employ automated tools and other techniques so as to help comply with legal requirements concerning your personal information. In all cases, you are not allowed to share personal information of others, including through any comment or message posted on Group walls, private or public chats, forums or personal posts. Personal information includes:  Full name; Email; Password; Home or other address; Telephone number; Social security, passport, or national identity number; Real life, personal, or family photos (these are not permitted to be uploaded for community safety). and Other personally identifiable information.    Harassment and cyberbullying. We do not tolerate this. Examples include comments or actions meant to:  Stalk, bully, intimidate, hurt, attack, abuse or humiliate someone (or something that a person may care about). \\xa0This includes using or encouraging the use of profanity (swearing); Reveal someone’s personal information; Sexualize someone or something, which would include sexual harassment and sexual bullying in any form; Harass or single out anyone (or something that a person cares about) for ridicule, abuse, malicious attack, or anything similar to that; Call out bad behavior of others publicly. You should use our reporting tools on the site to let us know of any bad behavior. and Incite others to do anything listed above.    Child endangerment. We have users of all ages and we want to create safe environment for all of them, including children. So, we do not allow any actions that could put children in inappropriate or dangerous situations, including:  Grooming and other predatory behavior; Anything that sexualizes children. and Any other actions or comments that are listed in these Rules that are directed to or are about children.    Hate speech or actions. You are not allowed to engage in discriminatory speech or actions, based on any of the following:  Race or ethnic origin; National origin; Religion or religious affiliation; Disability or disease; Gender, gender identity or sexual orientation; Age. or Veteran status.  The example content below is not permitted on Roblox. The list below provides some examples but is not exhaustive. Roblox Safety Moderation team will block inappropriate content within these rules.  Clothing with red arm bands; Confederate flags. and Ugandan Knuckles memes.    Impersonation and defamation. We all treasure our identities and we don\\'t want to be defamed. You are not allowed to impersonate another person’s identity, defame someone or commit libel. This would include impersonating another player, celebrity, a Roblox employee, the police, government official or anyone else. So, do not use any of the following that is associated with someone else in order to pass yourself off as that person.  Name or username; Position in a company; Digital representation; A post or comment. and Personal information.    Threats and self-harm. In the digital environment, it is hard to tell what is a joke or is serious. So, we take all threats seriously and do not allow any threats on Roblox. We also take reports of self-harm very seriously. We are in active communication with police departments across the globe and often report threats\\xa0related to physical harm or public safety.  Looking for dates or dating partners. As a social platform for play, Roblox tries to provide a safe place to meet on-line friends, play, chat, and collaborate on creative projects. However, this is not the place to look for dating partners.  Sexual content or overly violent content. We do not allow such content, including:  Sexual content or acts, sexual violence, exploitation of any kind, or excessive violence. This includes such content whether or not nudity is involved and whether or not it would rise to level of being pornographic or being explicit; Content that implies or makes an avatar appear naked or in underwear/undergarments. and Atrocities, massacres, and other shocking real (or pseudo-real) world events.

We will not tolerate discrimination based on any of the protected characteristics above, including participants with disabilities.  Other activities. We remind you of the Rules listed above. This list is not meant to be exhaustive. Here are a couple of other items to keep in mind:  You may offer promo codes only for in-game items, content or currency in your games. Promo codes cannot promise Robux or digital goods that are not part of the game. Promo codes must be clearly labeled for your in-game content only and should not appear to be official Roblox offers or offer official Roblox items or Robux. As discussed in Roblox Terms of Use, you cannot (and you cannot allow others) sell, trade or give away Robux, digital goods or game codes except through official channels on Roblox platform. For example, you\\xa0cannot\\xa0conduct such transactions through chat, Roblox Groups, or third-party apps or websites.\\xa0You also cannot buy or sell Roblox games or Groups. Third parties sell or provide Game eCards (which are physical cards or digital items that provide a code that you can use to redeem Robux or other virtual items on Roblox). Those Game eCards have their own terms and conditions associated with them. If you want to sell, give away or do anything else with those eCards outside of Roblox (on an external website or social media channel), then we take no position as to those actions. However, we recommend you check the T&amp;Cs of the eCard and place you want to do the action to see if that is allowed. Certain trades are allowed through Roblox. (Found by clicking on \"Trade\" on the toolbar). No other method of trading is permitted on or off Roblox. Exploiting is not permitted in Roblox. This includes inappropriately obtaining and uploading \"stolen\" game content. Roblox moderators will determine exploited game content at their discretion with the tools available to them and may immediately terminate accounts caught participating in this behavior. Offsite website links, services, and additional 3rd party content are not permitted on Roblox with the following exceptions: YouTube, Twitter, Twitch. Users under the age of 13 are not permitted to share YouTube, Twitter, Twitch links for their privacy and safety. Permitted offsite links, content, or references must contain Roblox appropriate content or your account will be moderated up to immediate termination. Using partial links, filter-breaking, using permitted website links to indirectly link to non-permitted sites, content, or services, describing or otherwise encouraging users to go to unpermitted offsite links, content, or services is also not allowed. Roblox Terms of Use\\xa0have many terms and conditions that you must follow to use Roblox. Please make sure you read those Terms.    Consequences and Violations. The type and degree of action that we take for violations (i.e., a violation of Roblox Terms of Use and other terms that are part of those General Terms, including these Rules) is judged on a case-by-case basis (in our sole discretion). We weigh the type of violation, whether you are repeat offender and other factors. You should understand the following:  Certain minor violations will result in a warning or temporary ban. More serious violations will result in a permanent ban. If your violation is a serious one, we may not allow you to participate in our DevEx program and you may lose all rights to any Robux, virtual goods, or other items that you may have earned, purchased or otherwise acquired or Provided (as that term is defined in the Roblox Terms of Use) to us. We actively work with law enforcement agencies throughout the world, and regularly report illegal activity, threats to others, threats of self-harm and other relevant items to them. If you have multiple accounts, we reserve the right to take action against all of your accounts for any single or multiple violations. The account holder is responsible for all violations that occur on that person’s account. So, never give your password to anyone else (except if you are a minor, to your legal guardian). Do not discuss publicly any actions that we have taken against you or anyone else for a violation. If you have questions about any action that we have taken against your account for a violation, you can contact us at appeals@roblox.com. If you violate these Rules when participating in a life event organized by, or on behalf of Roblox, you may be sanctioned, or expelled from the event, at the discretion of the event organizers.     Section II. Additional Rules for Developers. To be clear, Developers must follow all the \"Basic Rules\" listed above. As a community, we strive to make Roblox a safe and enjoyable place for everyone and appreciate your efforts in helping us build this positive environment. These Community Rules for Developers outline the acceptable and appropriate ways to build and publish games on Roblox. If you have any questions about how to interpret these Rules and how they might apply to your particular case, please send them to info@roblox.com. If you know of anyone or any game that is violating these Rules, please\\xa0report all violations by using our Report Abuse\\xa0system, which is located throughout the site and in-game. \\xa0Please remember to periodically review these Rules, as they will be updated from time to time. Any attempt to violate or go around these Rules will result in the game being suspended or completely removed. the user account or Group associated with the game may also be deleted. \\xa0Roblox does hear appeals for moderation consequences on a case by case basis, but reserves the right to act on the matter in the way that it deems appropriate. If you would like to request an appeal, email appeals@roblox.com.   Building your game. When building your game, it’s important to do the following:   Filter all chat and text. Developers must pass all chat and/or game text through Roblox’s filtering system. Roblox scans all chat communication and player inputted text for the safety of our users and legal compliance reasons,\\xa0including\\xa0the\\xa0Children\\'s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). All chat and content must also be reportable through the Report Abuse system.  Keep your game description up-to-date.  Enable users of your game to contact you\\xa0so you can support your game.  Don’t build a game that encourages (or redirects) users to go off Roblox.  Do not ask for or collect (or allow the transfer between players in your game) any personally identifiable information (PII).\\xa0For example, you should not ask for a player’s first and last name, age, home or physical address, something that contains a person’s image or voice (such as a photograph, video or audio file), social security number, passport number (or national identity number), phone number or email address (or other forms of online contact information).  Do not implement any gambling or casino style games that involve real money in any way. This includes Robux, as Robux can be purchased for real money. Games should also be fair and not be skewed in the developer\\'s favor.  Do not create promotions offering prizes of any sort (including contests, raffles, lotteries, chain letters or any kind of giveaway). It is okay to offer players promo codes for in-game items only so long as they are not in exchange for something (e.g., in exchange for a thumb up on your game).  Do not sell, trade or give away Roblox currency, digital goods or game codes outside of the channels provided to the users on the Roblox site.\\xa0Third parties sell or provide eCards (which are physical cards or digital items that provide a code that you can use to redeem Robux or other virtual items on the Services). Those Game eCards have their own terms and conditions associated with them. If you want to sell, give away or do anything else with those eCards\\xa0outside of Roblox\\xa0(on an external website or social media channel), then we take no position as to those actions. However, we recommend you check with the terms of those eCards and place you want to take the actions.  Assist with rolling out technical features and updates, which may be for security, stability, legal or other reasons, and may include updating your game or other content.  Do not upload, Publish, or otherwise Provide games or any other User Generated Creations (\"UGC\") that have previously been moderated or suspended from access on Roblox, whether that content was created by you or someone else. Developers must ensure that their games and all content within their games abide by the rules. Developers who are terminated or banned from Roblox may not transfer their creations or allow others to create derivative works from them. The terms \"Publish,\" \"Provide,\" and \"UGC\" as used here have the same definitions as those described in the Roblox Terms of Use.  Do not copy, transfer, display, or otherwise use the UGC of other users outside of Roblox, including on other gaming platforms or on physical mediums, such as clothing.    Creating positive game experiences. When designing your game, focus on providing positive game experiences for our community (e.g., working in a pizza restaurant, building a theme park, etc.). You should encourage the proper use of your game and never directly or indirectly encourage inappropriate behavior. For example, experiences within a game should not have an inappropriate theme (sleepover/slumber parties), contain nude or partially clothed characters, or display suggestive animations. Below is a list of inappropriate behaviors (and please note this list is not comprehensive. you should think through if you are providing or promoting inappropriate behavior):  Providing users’ personal information; Harassment or bullying; Using or encouraging the use of profanity (swearing); Child endangerment; Hate speech or actions; Impersonation and defamation; Threats and self-harm; Looking for dates or dating partners; Sexual content or overly violent content; Dangerous, unethical and illegal activities. or Content that implies or makes an avatar appear naked or in underwear/undergarments. This includes solid color avatars without clothing.    Using appropriate content. Inappropriate content is not allowed within Roblox games.\\xa0Do not create or upload any images, videos, audio files or other content (including animations or scripting), discuss topics or use language that falls in the bulleted list above. Do not upload or use content or materials that you do not own or have permission from the owner to use. If we are notified that your uploaded content violates another’s intellectual property rights, we will block or remove that content without notice and follow the process set out in Roblox Terms of Use. Roblox\\xa0actively monitors game content and text.\\xa0Some violations are blocked automatically through the use of filters and other detection systems. And we moderate and take other actions regarding content when flagged by our community.  Any consequences applied to violators are at the sole discretion of Roblox and may range in severity from a warning to account deletion; Violations are dealt with in a manner that reflects the severity of the violation and the threat to the Roblox community. Important additional information on inappropriate content:  All text in uploaded images must be clearly visible to Roblox moderators. Images with tiny, unclear, or unreadable text will be blocked from upload. Pills, syringes, or other content representing drug paraphernalia or drug use are not permitted. Alcohol, alcoholic references, drunkenness, smoking cigarettes, cigars, and vaping are not permitted. Distorted audio, including excessively slowing down or speeding up the audio content to make it indiscernible, and audio that is excessively loud including screaming, high-pitched or excessive noises are not permitted. Dating is not permitted on Roblox. This includes content that explicitly or implicitly promotes, encourages, or references dating. \"Clickbait\" advertisements are not permitted. Advertisements such as \"Click this 1000 times\", \"Click to pick your Dominus\" or ones that offer free Robux, Roblox virtual items, etc. or that otherwise falsely represent the content being advertised and solely exist to encourage a user to click on the ad to inflate ad clicks are not permitted.      Reporting Issues. If you see another user or content on our site or in a game, please use the Report Abuse feature to file a report within our moderation systems. You can find the Report Abuse option within any game, chat or content on Roblox. Roblox employs both moderation technology systems and a team of moderators to pre-review content and reports of violations of our Community Rules and Terms of Use.

This way we make sure that nobody between you and us can see your searches.  We do not, and never will, share or sell any data we collect ourselves with any third party. We remove parts of the IP address when we store it so they become anonymous. For example 192.168.152.223 becomes 192.168.XXX.XXX We do not use unique event fingerprinting We send all data collected from Ecosia services over an SSL-secured connection We store all analytics data in an highly encrypted database We only keep fully anonymised search data after 7 days  We only keep fully anonymised search data after 7 days  If you have \"Do Not Track\" enabled in your browser settings we do not collect any analytics data. Ecosia’s servers are located around the world in order to provide a fast response no matter where you are. However, when you perform a search on Ecosia, your request will generally be routed to the server that is geographically nearest to you. That means, for example, if you are located in Germany your search traffic will remain within Germany and will fall under strict German privacy regulations. We also save the searches we receive to filter spam. Information stored in our cookies include:  Your country and language settings Whether or not you have installed an extension The value of your search counter Your adult filter settings The timestamp of your last search  Your Bing Client ID (if enabled) In some cases which way you have found out about Ecosia We do not store any personal information in the cookie. After 7 days we remove all personal information (like the IP address) from the search data we collect ourselves. We will never share your searches with anyone except services that are directly involved in answering your search request, like Bing. Ecosia does use third party tools on non-search pages where absolutely necessary to help us understand and tune our marketing campaigns. For example, we may run an ad campaign on a social media site that requires us to share some data about user activity in order to help us understand how effective that campaign is. For more information on how Bing handles your data see their privacy policy. There are only a few search engines with their own web index - for example Google, Bing, Yandex and Baidu. Most other general web search engines cooperate and share data with these companies in some form. We currently work with Bing and are very transparent about what we share with them. Beyond that, no search engine can ever provide perfect protection of your search data, because other parties – like your network provider or browser for example – might still be able to access some of your data. If you think somebody might be after you, we would recommend checking out security tools like VPNs and services like TOR. Want to dive into the fine print?
